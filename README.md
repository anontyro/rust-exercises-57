# Rust Practice Exercises

This repository is inspired by the book Exercises for [Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills](https://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Programmers-Challenges-Develop-Coding/dp/1680501224/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=pragmatic+programmers+57+challenges&qid=1574773745&sr=8-1) which encourages learning by doing and this is generally how I prefer to work!

This project doesn't contain every exercise as I ended up picking an choosing a cross section which I felt helped push me long without being totally exhaustive.

## Running the project

I have created the project in Rust with a command line to allow choosing of what program to run, using `cargo run` you are able to build and run the project
